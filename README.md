# PodcastData

Running podcasts.py will produce a Microsoft Excel sheet with a list of shows you have episodes saved for, ordered from greatest to least in terms of number of episodes saved. This is a cool way of getting around the fact that Apple Podcasts offers saved episode counts in the app, while Spotify currently does not.
