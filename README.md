# PodcastData

Running podcasts.py will produce a Microsoft Excel sheet with a list of shows you have episodes saved for, ordered from greatest to least in terms of number of episodes saved. This is a cool way of getting around the fact that Apple Podcasts offers saved episode counts in the app, while Spotify currently does not.

Most of the actual API connection code is not mine - I do not claim to have written it and found the source code on GitHub - will attribute proper source when I find it again.
